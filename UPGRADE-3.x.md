UPGRADE 3.x
===========

UPGRADE FROM 3.17 to 3.18
=========================

### Deprecate API

Integration with FOSRest, JMS Serializer and Nelmio Api Docs is deprecated, the ReST API provided with this bundle will be removed on 4.0.

If you are relying on this, consider moving to other solution like [API Platform](https://api-platform.com/) instead.

UPGRADE FROM 3.16 to 3.17
=========================

### `Sonata\ClassificationBundle\Model\CategoryInterface`

The classes implementing the interface `CategoryInterface` SHOULD declare the methods
`__toString()` and `getId()`, as they will be required in version 4.x.

### `Sonata\ClassificationBundle\Model\CollectionInterface`

The classes implementing the interface `CollectionInterface` SHOULD declare the method
`getId()`, as it will be required in version 4.x.

### `Sonata\ClassificationBundle\Model\TagInterface`

The classes implementing the interface `TagInterface` SHOULD declare the method
`getId()`, as it will be required in version 4.x.

UPGRADE FROM 3.13 to 3.14
=========================

### Support for NelmioApiDocBundle > 3.6 is added

Since version 3.x, support for nelmio/api-doc-bundle > 3.6 is added. Controllers for NelmioApiDocBundle v2 were moved under `Sonata\ClassificationBundle\Controller\Api\Legacy\` namespace and controllers for NelmioApiDocBundle v3 were added as replacement. If you extend them, you must ensure they are using the corresponding inheritance.

UPGRADE FROM 3.12 to 3.13
=========================

### SonataEasyExtends is deprecated

Registering `SonataEasyExtendsBundle` bundle is deprecated, it SHOULD NOT be registered.
Register `SonataDoctrineBundle` bundle instead.

UPGRADE FROM 3.1 to 3.2
=======================

### Deep validation

In `CategoryAdmin` and `CollectionAdmin`,
disabling deep validation by unsetting the `cascade_validation` option is now deprecated,
and should be done by overriding `getFormBuilder` instead.

### Tests

All files under the ``Tests`` directory are now correctly handled as internal test classes.
You can't extend them anymore, because they are only loaded when running internal tests.
More information can be found in the [composer docs](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#autoload-dev).
